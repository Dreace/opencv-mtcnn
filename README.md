# opencv-mtcnn

This is an inference implementation of MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Network) to perform Face Detection and Alignment using OpenCV's DNN module.

## OpenCV's DNN module

Since OpenCV 3.1 there is a module called DNN that provides the inference support. The module is capable of taking models & weights from various popular frameworks such as Caffe, tensorflow, darknet etc.

You can read more about it here - https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Deep-Learning-in-OpenCV

Note that at present there is no support to perform training in OpenCV's DNN module and if I understood correctly there is no intention either.

## Acknowledgments

Most of the implementations of MTCNN are based on either Caffe or Tensorflow. I wanted to play with OpenCV's DNN implementation and understand the paper bit better. While implementing, I did look at various other C++ implementations and more specifically borrowed utilities from https://github.com/golunovas/mtcnn-cpp. IMHO, I found his implementation (in C++) that is based on Caffe to be the cleanest amongst many others.
